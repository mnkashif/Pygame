This is an always running game, in which the player gets points till the time he avoids all obstacles and does not die.
The obstacles are spikes and the enemies are goblins whom you can kill with bullets.You get points for killing them also.
You can avoid them by jumping using the up arrow key and shoot using te spacebar.
This is just a prototype of the game.
